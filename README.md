# Industrial Software Development with C++ for Embedded Systems
This project involved developing essential skills in software development for embedded systems, focusing on applying C++ programming knowledge to practical tasks. It was divided into two main sections:

## Section 1: C++ Programming Fundamentals
Over the first three days, I refreshed my C++ programming knowledge and expanded it into the object-oriented paradigm of C++. Through numerous hands-on programming tasks, I solidified my understanding of:

* Classes as central data structures
* Object-oriented methods
* Recursive programming
* Polymorphism

## Section 2: Robot Control Development on FORBOT A4
In the second part of the project, I applied the knowledge gained to develop control systems for the FORBOT A4 robot (from Roboterwerk) using a Raspberry Pi. The focus was on key strategies for integrating sensors and actuators, including:

* Using Hall sensors for sensing tasks
* Controlling actuators like motor controllers
* Interfacing with peripherals such as keyboards

## Project Objectives
The main goal was to program a robot control system that could be operated via a keyboard and also execute pre-configured maneuvers, such as driving in a circle or figure-eight pattern. This involved:

* Developing a predictor to estimate the robot's position
* Calculating the trajectory points for each maneuver
* Testing and validating the control code in a simulation environment, followed by trials on actual hardware
* This project offered practical experience in both software development and system integration, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on application.
